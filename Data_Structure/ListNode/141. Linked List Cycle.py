# Given head, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it. There is a cycle in a linked
# list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the next pointer.
# Internally, pos is used to denote the index of the node that tail's next pointer is connected to. Note that pos is
# not passed as a parameter. Return true if there is a cycle in the linked list. Otherwise, return false.

# Example 1:
# Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
# Output: true
# Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 1st node (0-indexed).
# Example 2:
# Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
# Output: true
# Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 0th node.
# Example 3:
# Input: head = [1], pos = -1
# Output: false
# Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list.

# Constraints:
# The number of the nodes in the list is in the range [0, 104].
# -105 <= Node.val <= 105
# pos is -1 or a valid index in the linked-list.
# Follow up: Can you solve it using O(1) (i.e. constant) memory?

# 思路： 1. hashmap， 把之前见过的node指向的位置存下来
#       2. Floyd's Cycle Finding Algorithm

                return False
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next.next
